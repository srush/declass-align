McCone said we are proposing a ratio of 1 to I, and the British are
proposing a ratio of 2-I/2 to I; he thought we could, and should,
settle out for a ratio of 2 to 1. The President asked if this
appeared to be a good trade from the standpoint of availability of
the two products, and Mr. McCone said it is very definitely so,
inasmuch as our needs for plutonium are rising, with small weapons.

for Turkey for the period FY 1957-60 should provide for such
advanced weapons as the Honest John, the NIKE, and the F-100,
for appropriate conventional equipment, and for recurring
maintenance costs. The United States should review the
possibility of achieving a reduction in NATO-approved force
levels for Turkey and, in phase with the effective integration
of advanced weapons in the Turkish armed forces, appropriately
revise Turkish force levels in the light of NATO requirements.
In such review, consideration should also be given to the

force. He stated that there was a reluctance on the part of the Service

suspend any "effective action" by the British until after the Washington

Secretary Dulles said that, pending the arrival of Eden and
Macmillan, it was highly desirable that a careful study of the U. S.
position in response to British pressure should be prepared. Accordingly,
an interdepartmental group within the Council on Foreign Economic
Policy had been set up to undertake the preparation of this
study. Secretary Dulles then read language which he suggested should
be adopted as the "mandate" for the interdepartmental group\'s study.
Secretary Dulles predicted that we would be obliged to give

123	1	Admiral Strauss thought it would be very dangerous if
word got about that the United States Government would not protect
defectors from being shanghaied and forcibly returned to the Communist
countries of their origin. If such views became widespread,
we could anticipate a cessation of the flow of defectors. Secretary
Dulles hastened to say that he was making no suggestion that
we would not protect defectors from forcible return. He had only
meant to suggest that if defectors voluntarily wished to return,
he could see no sense in our trying to keep then here in the United
States.

Governor Stassen said he agreed with the warning statement
of Admiral Strauss. It is widely believed that the five "Tuapse"
sailors were in fact shanghaied. This belief is dangerous for the
United States and gives the public a completely erroneous impression.
On the other hand, Governor Stassen agreed that it was all right to
send defectors back if they decide of their own free will that they
wish to return. Secretary Wilson said that above all, we must take
care that no coercion is exerted by the U. S. authorities.

Secretary Dulles said that we should frankly face the fact
that as more and more changes occur in the Soviet Union in the direction
of liberalization, more and more defectors will wish to return.
Some of the changes in the Soviet Union which had occurred in
recent months were obviously genuine changes. If the Soviet Union
proceeds to liquidate labor camps and to cease to compel its citizens
to be tied to their jobs, defectors will desire to go back.
We should take great pains not to let such a return movement be
signalled as a defeat for the United States in the cold war. After
all, it is one of our great objectives to induce Soviet Russia to
become a decent member of the society of nations. There is now evidence
that the Soviet Union is moving in that direction. We should
welcome and facilitate such developments, and make no issue whatever
of voluntary redefection. To do so would be to create a false issue.
The tendency underlying the current policy paper is that we should
undertake to try to prevent defectors from returning to their Communist
homelands, and that failure to prevent their return must be
regarded as a defeat for U. S. policy. This was fundamentally erroneous.
