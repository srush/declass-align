Mr. McCone said that Sir Edwin Flowden, who had been his host in 
 the United Kingdom in November, is coming to the United States 
 about 1 March for two or three days to visit atomic installations. 
 He asked if the President would be agreeable to attending a luncheon 
 or dinner for him. The President said he would prefer to have a 
 stag luncheon, suggesting the date of March 2, with the British 
 Ambassador also present.  
Mr. McCone next reported to the President that the British wished 
 to buy a substantial quantity of refined atomic materials. Defense, 
 State and the Commission agree on the desirability of supplying 
 them. 
 The British would like to pay for the plutonium 
 (to be available in the near future) in cash, and to pay for the U-235 
 over a longer period with plutonium. The President asked what 
 ratio would be used in accepting plutonium for our U-235. Mr. 
 McCone said we are proposing a ratio of 1 to I, and the British are 
 proposing a ratio of 2-I/2 to I; he thought we could, and should, 
 settle out for a ratio of 2 to 1. The President asked if this 
 appeared to be a good trade from the standpoint of availability of 
 the two products, and Mr. McCone said it is very definitely so, 
 inasmuch as our needs for plutonium are rising, with small weapons. 
 He added that State and Defense agree on this. The President 
 said the proposition looked generally satisfactory to him.

 28. During FY 1957 and FY 1958, continue to support 
 Turkish force levels of 20 8/3 divisions, 64 combatant ships, 
 and 21 air force squadrons. The total military aid program 
 for Turkey for the period FY 1957-60 should provide for such 
 advanced weapons as the Honest John, the NIKE, and the F-100, 
 for appropriate conventional equipment, and for recurring 
 maintenance costs. The United States should review the 
 possibility of achieving a reduction in NATO-approved force 
 levels for Turkey and, in phase with the effective integration 
 of advanced weapons in the Turkish armed forces, appropriately 
 revise Turkish force levels in the light of NATO requirements. 
 In such review, consideration should also be given to the 
 role of turkish forces under the Baghdad Pact.*

 You see, the Malayans say and the Indonesians say all they want is an opportunity 
 to compete with synthetic rubber on an unsubsidized basic. They 
 say they can compete. They believe, despite what we say, we are still subsidizing

 the United States had not 
 pressed Germany for greater contributions to assist underdeveloped countries 
 and to pay for the military expenses which were now being provided by the 
 United States. He expressed the judgment that, while this problem involved 
 foreign relations and political considerations in foreign countries, with 
 particular reference to the NATO structure, he believed that we had run out 
 of time and that something had to be done of a sufficient order of magnitude 
 that would indicate a resolution on the part of the United States to bring 
 its balance of payments into more reasonable equilibrium. 
 The President stated that he was aware of the magnitude of the problem 	0	10->20

 reduction in forces in Europe and a reduction in dependents and had been confronted

 Defense to be adverse political circumstances in European countries. He 
 thought the time had now come when the United States had to very firmly take 
 a position that would bring about a substantial improvement in our balance 
 of payments problem. 
 The Secretary of Defense stated that he doubted the continuing validity 
 of the "sword and shield" concept of mutual defense, since it was agreed by 
 most military authorities that a limited European war was not likely and that 
 any military action which involved the NATO forces would most likely precipitate 
 defense actions on a larger scale and the use of other types of military 
 force. He stated that there was a reluctance on the part of the Service 
 chiefs and the Joint Chiefs of Staff to alter their concepts and that they 
 had become rather "frozen" in their positions. He further stated that the

76	1	Left to its own free judgment, and unimpeded by the question 
 of its obligations to the U.S. and its future relations to the Federal 
 Republic, the British Government, in these circumstances, would 
 almost surely prefer not to join in the multilateral force. But in 
 the months after January 14 there has been a new appreciation in 
 London of the importance of the Federal Republic, and it remains 
 a fact that in the joint effort launched at Nassau the Americans, 
 in June, have done their full part in support of those matters which 
 were of greatest interest to the UK. Therefore it seems possible 
 that if the United States Government insists with sufficient energy, the 
 British will agree to join.

79	1	THE RESPONSE OF THE BRITISH--BOTH THE FOREIGN SECRETARY AND 
 LATER THE PRIME MINISTER--WAS DIRECTED AT THE CONTINGENCY 
 NATURE OF BRITISH PLANNING. THE UNDERLYING BRITISH CONCERN 
 WAS THAT THE FUTURE BEHAVIOR OF LEE COULD NOT BE PRECISELY 
 PREDICTED. THEY DID NOT KNOW WHETHER OR NOT HE MIGHT SEEK TO 
 ALIGN HIMSELF WITH THE AFRO-ASINA POWERS. THEY FELT THEREFORE 
 THAT SOME KIND OF CONTINGENCY PLANNING WAS NECESSARY.  
AT THE SAME TIME BOTH THE FONSEC AND THE PM CATEGORICALLY REJECTED 
 THE IDEA THAT THEY WERE SEEKING AN EASY WAY OUT OF 
 BRITISH COMMITMENTS.  
THEY THEREFORE FELT THAT FOUR-POWER TALKS MIGHT BE USEFUL, NOT 
 FOR THE PURPOSE OF PREPARING A BRITISH WITHDRAWAL, BUT RATHER 
 WITH THE INTENTION OF DEVELOPING ALTERNATIVE COURSES OF ACTION 
 IN THE EVENT THAT THE SINGAPORE BASE PROVED UNTENABLE.  
THE END RESULT OF THE UNDER SECRETARY\'S CONVERSATIONS 
 WITH BOTH THE FONSEC AND THE PM WAS A CATEGORICAL ASSURANCE 
 THAT THE UKG HAD NO PRESENT INTENTION OF REDUCING ITS COMMITMENTS 
 IN SEA, BUT THAT IT WAS MERELY SEEKING TO DEVELOP ALTERNATIVE 
 ARRANGEMENTS IN THE EVENT THAT THE USE OF THE SINGAPORE BASE 
 WAS PROGRESSIVELY CIRCUMSCRIBED. BOTH THE FONSEC AND THE PM 
 ALSO INDICATED CLEARLY THAT THEY HAD DROPPED THE IDEA OF ANY 
 NEGOTIATIONS TO END THE CONFRONTATION.

 the best chance may be to make a deal with Iraq and Kuwait. 
 Secretary Dulles said this idea is very speculative. We must ask 
 whether this action would end with Arab nationalism or whether the 
 whole area would be taken over by Communism. Mr. McElroy said 
 he had assumed we could be invited in to safeguard oil positions 
 as in Jordan. Secretary Dulles said that these are positions that 
 are more readily held, being chiefly desert wastes. 
 The President asked 
 whether the labor in the oil installations is not all native, and was 
 told that essentially it is. he felt the facilities could not operate 
 in case of a general strike. Mr. Dulles said he would study the 
 matter further. 
 Mr. Dulles next turned to the situation in sudan. The government 
 has asked the British if they would send forces in if requested. Mr. 
 Allen asked whether we could not instead give them assurance of the 
 fullest support in the United Nations. Secretary Dulles said we can\'t 
 help Faisal. Abdul and Nuri very much in the United Nations. the

 President, should the President so desire, and also that Selwyn Lloyd 
 thinks he should come over to talk with us (Mr. Dulles did not think 
 this is necessary), and finally that, if we go into Lebanon, the 
 British would have to go into Iraq, and they would want to know if 
 we can help and support them there. The President said that it 
 might be better to put our troops into Lebanon unilaterally. Mr. 
 Dulles recalled that we had been working closely with the British on 
 this whole matter. He also said that the United Kingdom has been 
 asked by King Hussein of Jordan for help. The President said he 
 thought we could give them logistical support, but did not see how we 
 could commit ourselves quickly to do more. (since this would exceed 
 his constitutional authority without legislative action)

 that he could see very little point in any meeting with the British 
 if they took actions of this sort prior to the meeting. Secretary 
 Dulles added that he had not been quite as blunt in his language as he 
 now sounded, but very nearly so. Macmillan had replied that he would 
 suspend any "effective action" by the British until after the Washington 
 meeting. 
 Secretary Dulles said that, pending the arrival of Eden and 
 Macmillan, it was highly desirable that a careful study of the U. S. 
 position in response to British pressure should be prepared. Accordingly, 
 an interdepartmental group within the Council on Foreign Economic 
 Policy had been set up to undertake the preparation of this 
 study. Secretary Dulles then read language which he suggested should 
 be adopted as the "mandate" for the interdepartmental group\'s study. 
 Secretary Dulles predicted that we would be obliged to give 
 way somewhat to British demands if the problem were to be solved. Accordingly, 
 we must determine what minimum concessions to the British 
 point of view would be acceptable to us. By this course of action we 
 may be able to hold the Cocom system together.

 II. History of U.S. Efforts on Behalf of Refugees and Escapees 
 The United States Government has traditionally taken a keen interest 
 in the problems of refugees and escapees, because of the him 
 considerations involved, as well as the political, economic and psychological 
 significance of these groups. The Intergovernmental Committee 
 for Refugees (ICGR) was organized in August, 1938 at the conference convinced 
 at Evian, France on the initiative of president Roosevelt. The 
 Committee assisted in the recottlement of refugees from Nazism until 
 its termination on June 30, 1947. During the period of hostilities, the 
 Committee worked closely with the U.S. War Refuges Board in securing the 
 escape of refugees from Europe. 	0	5->17

 example, the ruler there is the Shah, who says that his power was 
 given to him by God. Everybody knows how this power was seized 
 by the Shah\'s father, who has been a Sergeant in the Iranian Army 
 and who had usurped the throne by means of murder, plunder, and 
 violence. Now the United States supports the Shah and the Iranian 
 People transfer, as it were, their anger from the Shah to the 
 United States. The United States is spending vast sums of money 
 in Iran but that money does not go to the people; it is plundered 
 by the Shah\'s entourage. The situation with regard to Franco is

 ability to maintain and defend Western interests in some of the 
 Near Eastern countries. Nevertheless, Britain does continue 
 to retain a position of substantial importance in the area. The 
 decline in British ability to handle the situation is not only 
 due to the decline in her relative power position in the 
 world but also to the increasing complexity and demands of the 
 situation in the area. This has made it necessary for the 
 United States to play an increasingly important role, a situation 
 which will continue for the foreseeable future.
